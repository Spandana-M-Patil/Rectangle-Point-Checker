# Rectangle-Point-Checker
# Description
A simple project that generates co-ordinates of the rectangle and allows user to enter the point in order to check if the point lies within the rectangle or not. Additionally, the project calculates the area of the rectangle and visually represents the rectangle and the point using the `turtle` graphics module.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Spandana-M-Patil/Rectangle-Point-Checker.git
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd Rectangle-Point-Checker
### Usage
1. Run the script
   ```bash
   GamingRectangle
2.Enter the X and Y coordinates when prompted to check if the point lies within the generated rectangle.
3.Enter your guess for the area of the rectangle when prompted.
### Example
      Cordinates of rectangle are 84,64 and 131,126
      X coord: 90
      Y coord: 90
      Your answer is True
      Area of rectangle : 2850
      Oops!! Area is 2914 sq m
## Project Structure
- `GamingRectangle.py`: The main script that contains the logic for generating points, checking if a point lies within a rectangle, calculating the area, and drawing the shapes using turtle.
